• Gene Ontology annotations (GAF 2.0) on Mycobacterium tuberculosis
H37Rv (MYCTU)

• paper-centric: nearly all papers from Pubmed search on MYCTU up to and
including publication date 2009 (<PMID 20000000)

• private, one-man effort

• updated yearly

• excluding results based on microarrays only


Quality control

---------------

• several manual checks, incl. random rechecks

• using homegrown ruby scripts, several further tests

• using filter-gene-association.pl
<http://filter-gene-association.pl/>script from gene-ontology.org
<http://gene-ontology.org/>

• applied corrections after check by UniProtKB-GOA group


Statistics

----------

• 1,056 papers

• 2,320 proteins

• 57 per cent of genome

• 6,731 annotations using 817 kB


Methods and software

--------------------

• Pubmed for title/abstract search of relevant papers among >25,000
MYCTU papers

• Phenote editor for annotations

• Bibdesk bibliography software

• web sites from GO, QuickGO, UniProt, tuberculist.epfl.ch
<http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/>, ChEBI

• added/corrected several GO entries via Sourceforge

• ruby for quality control and translation to GAF 2.0

• perl for quality control
